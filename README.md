Programming for beginners can be frustrating and overwhelming. Finding errors in code and debugging isn't all the fun. So, we ask for help. We explain our train of thought and rationale behind the code. Then suddenly, wait, oh that's why it wasn't working! 

Explaining your ideas to someone allows you to process and find greater, better solutions. Try it, you might be surprised how useful it is. In code debugging, there is this term called: Rubber duck debugging. In which, one explains their code to a rubber ducky. 

So, how do we make this practice better? Buttons! Fidget toys help a user channel their energy into the toy, helping them to improve focus. By combining a rubber duck and fidget toy, I aim to create the ultimate coding companion. 

## What it does

Agent Bucky is a ducky to help debug(gy). 

1. Bucky's debugging services: It has buttons for users to fidget with. If Bucky detects high-stress levels from the user (a lot of button presses), it calls and asks the user to explain their code to him. If after the session, the user is still stuck, Bucky will redirect them to an online resource for more help. 

2. Bucky's logs: Every time the user speaks to Bucky, it saves the conversation, uploads it and is available for viewing online (or by accessing the Html file).

3. Bucky's adventure: Continue spamming clicks on the webpage and let Bucky tell you fun programming memes.
